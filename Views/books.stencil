    <h2>Programming with Swift</h2>
    <p>
        This book is currently in development and targeted for early '19. It will focus on teaching Swift as
        a general purpose, cross-platform programming language and will target a novice to intermediate audience.
        As such, it should be the ideal textbook for entry-level programming courses.
        A large amount of exercises and challenges makes it suitable for self-learners as well.
    </p>

        <a href="https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-swift">Data Structures and Algorithms in Swift</a>
        is my second book as a technical editor for Ray Wenderlich.
        It covers essential data structures and algorithms, something every programmer should know!
    </p>
    <p>
        This book is up-to-date for Swift 4.2.

        The <a href="https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/swift-apprentice">Swift Apprentice</a> is out now,
        updated and revised for Swift 4.2. I am the technical editor for the second and third editions of this book.
        This was the first book I've ever worked on and I learned a lot from working with other authors, editors and publishers.
